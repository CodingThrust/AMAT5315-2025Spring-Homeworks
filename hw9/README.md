# Homework 9

1. (Integer programming) Use the integer programming for solving the maximum independent set problem. The maximum independent set problem is a well-known NP-complete problem that asks for the largest subset of vertices in a graph such that no two vertices in the subset are connected by an edge.

2. (Integer programming - optional) Improve the performance of the crystal structure prediction by tuning the integer programming solver SCIP. It is highly recommended to read the thesis [^Achterberg2009] to better understand the [parameters in SCIP](https://scip.zib.de/doc/html/PARAMETERS.php). Try to get a performance improvement of at least 2x. Submit your code and a report of your tuning process.
