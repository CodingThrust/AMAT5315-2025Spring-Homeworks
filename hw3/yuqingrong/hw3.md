   i. I can use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and sell OMEinsum.jl, as well as allow others to do the same, as long as you include the original copyright and permission notice in substantial portions of the software. I cannot hold the authors liable for any claims, damages, or issues arising from using the software, and there are no warranties provided, meaning you use it at your own risk.

  ii. Yes, OMEinsum.jl is compatible with ChainRulesCore.jl version 1.2. In its Project.toml, OMEinsum.jl specifies compatibility with ChainRulesCore version 1.x:
  ```julia
    [compat]
    ChainRulesCore = "1"
  ```
  This means any 1.x version of ChainRulesCore, including 1.2, is compatible with OMEinsum.jl. 

  iii. â€‹OMEinsum.jl achieves approximately 97% test coverage, excluding GPU-specific code. The GPU-related tests are executed during continuous integration but are not included in the coverage metrics.
